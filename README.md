## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. If you want to make major changes, or if you rewrite my whole code, please do not delete my code, just comment it out and state the reason why it is better to have your version.
I am also asking everyone to critique my code and give me a better idea. I am focusing on understanding Dart deeply and will move to Flutter whenever I am ready.
